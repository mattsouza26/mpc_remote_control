# MPC Remote Control

A Flutter app that allows you to remotely control Media Player Classic (MPC) on your Windows PC.


## About the Project
This is my first Flutter app, and I'm excited to share it with you! This open-source project was developed as a way for me to learn more about Flutter and mobile app development.

MPC Remote Control lets you control MPC using your smartphone or tablet. You can play, pause, skip forward or backward, adjust the volume, and more, all without having to be near your computer. This app works with both MPC and MPC-HC (Home Cinema) versions.

The app uses the MPC Web Interface to communicate with the MPC player, so make sure you have it enabled in MPC's options.

## Features
- Create custom commands besides default commands.
- Allow to control MPC using Notification.
- Navigate to files and open it.
- Find MPC servers and manager servers.
- Play & Pause on phone calls.
- Dark and Light mode.
